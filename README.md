## TODOs

 - Add the visibility line to the graph
 - Scale measurement graph with screen size, and display it. Currently it's only displayed on "xl" window size (desktops).
 - Fix overflowing heading and minimal picture size when the window height is too small.
 - Connect the website graph to the graph that is generated dynamically via the now deployment.
